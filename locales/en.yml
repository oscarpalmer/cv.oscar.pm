  about:
    - This site was created as a digital CV and resumé for me – <a class="link" href="https://oscar.pm">Oscar Palmér</a>! – to make it all accessible, not just for job searching, but also when applying other fun things.
    - It was developed with <a class="link" href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> as a foundation, along with <a class="link" href="https://github.com/oscarpalmer/anu">my own project template</a>, which includes many useful tools, e.g. <a class="link" href="http://haml.info">Haml</a> and <a class="link" href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, and I'm also using <a class="link" href="https://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a>. If this sounds weird – or even interesting – you're more than welcome to check out <a class="link" href="https://github.com/oscarpalmer/cv.oscar.pm">the site's source code on GitHub</a>.
    - I think that's it… have a nice day!

        paragraphs:
          - I have a lot of experience as a developer, particularly for the web, but also native environments. With regards to web development I'm quite comfortable with markup, stylesheet, and script languages, as well as various backend languages and environments.
          - Server environments I frequently make use of are <a class="link" href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> and <a class="link" href="https://jamstack.org">JAMstack</a> <i class="gray">(<a class="link" href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, <a class="link" href="https://zeit.co/now">Zeit</a>, etc.)</i>, but I have also published webbased projects on top of <a class="link" href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a>, as well as developed others with the help of <a class="link" href="https://www.iis.net">IIS</a>.
          - Regarding native development &ndash; non-webbased &ndash; I have also developed applications for both Windows and iOS.
