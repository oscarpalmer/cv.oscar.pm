          I have a lot of experience as a developer, particularly for the web, but also for native environments. With regards to web development I'm quite comfortable with markup, stylesheet, and script languages, as well as various backend languages and environments.

          Server environments I frequently make use of are <a class="link" href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> and <a class="link" href="https://jamstack.org">JAMstack</a> <i>(<a class="link" href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, <a class="link" href="https://zeit.co/now">Zeit</a>, etc.)</i>, but I have also published webbased projects on top of <a class="link" href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a>, as well as developed others with the help of <a class="link" href="https://www.iis.net">IIS</a>.
